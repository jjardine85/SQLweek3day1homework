## Extension

1.  Research how to delete multiple entries from your table in a single command.

      Delete all records - DELETE FROM table_name;
      This deletes all rows from a table but retains
      table structure, attributes and indexes

      Delete certain rows - DELETE FROM table WHERE id in (value1, value2) or
      DELETE FROM table WHERE id BETWEEN (value) AND (value)
